## Metadata Genius lyrics dataset

This dataset comes from a workshop written by Connor French ([Intro to Text Analysis](https://rpubs.com/confrench33/text_analysis_R)). The variables are:

- line: the lyrics, where each row is a line of lyrics

- section_name: The section of the song the lyrics are in, which in most cases is something like “Chorus”, “Verse”, etc. but it occasionally diverges

- song_name: The name of the song

- artist_name: Artist's name of the song

- line_number: The line number each line of the song is associated with. This is a useful identifier for when we split this data set into words.
